# Contributing to the FORTRESS Framework

We welcome contributions to the FORTRESS Framework — a community-driven project to formalize and improve physical security testing through a structured methodology similar to MITRE ATT&CK, but focused on the physical domain.

Whether you’re submitting new TTPs, refining compliance mappings, reporting issues, or improving documentation, we appreciate your time and expertise.

## 📌 Ground Rules

- **All contributions must be mapped to the FORTRESS hierarchy**: Super Section → Parent Section → Tactic/Technique/Procedure (TTP).
- **No random or vague submissions** — every item must have clear intent and utility for red teamers, blue teamers, or compliance professionals.
- Align findings and techniques with at least one **recognized compliance framework**, such as ISO 27001, NIST SP 800-53, HIPAA, PCI DSS, CMMC, etc.
- Submissions must be **original work** or based on publicly available, credited sources.
